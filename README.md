# Ok To Test
> _Example workflow configuration_ showing how to use GitHub Actions secrets in pull requests from forks üç¥üîë

## Summary
An [`Ok To Test`](https://github.com/imjohnbo/ok-to-test/blob/master/.github/workflows/ok-to-test.yml) workflow is configured so that when someone with write access to this repository comments `ok-to-test sha=<head-sha>` on a pull request from a fork, a "privileged" [`Integration tests`](https://github.com/imjohnbo/ok-to-test/blob/master/.github/workflows/integration.yml) workflow needing [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#about-encrypted-secrets) is triggered. In parallel, a "non-privileged" [`Unit tests`](https://github.com/imjohnbo/ok-to-test/blob/master/.github/workflows/unit.yml) workflow not needing secrets is triggered on any pull request.

## About

GitHub Actions purposely limits the [secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) available to pull requests from forks for security reasons:
- [`GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token#permissions-for-the-github_token) is read-only
- [Other secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#using-encrypted-secrets-in-a-workflow) aren't available at all

Though this provides peace of mind, many projects depend on the fork pull request model. If you've configured a GitHub Actions test workflow to trigger on pull requests, and those tests require secrets, the secrets aren't available and the workflow fails.

No longer with this workaround, which shows an example [Prow](https://prow.k8s.io/command-help)-like `/ok-to-test sha=<head-sha>` slash command configuration! ü•≥

## Setup

This is a [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#about-repository-templates) with three example workflows. Start by [creating a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template) ("Use this template"). Then, consider for your use case:
1. [Which type of token](#Authentication) you'll use to emit the `repository_dispatch` event in [`Ok To Test`](https://github.com/imjohnbo/ok-to-test/blob/master/.github/workflows/ok-to-test.yml). Set the secrets in your repository accordingly, e.g. [I used a GitHub App](https://github.com/imjohnbo/ok-to-test/blob/master/.github/workflows/ok-to-test.yml#L20-L21) and had to save secrets called `APP_ID` and `PRIVATE_KEY`. Remember: if you also choose GitHub App authentication (preferred), you must create _and install_ it on the repo(s) in which this configuration will run.
2. Which workflow(s) need [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#about-encrypted-secrets). In this example, it's [`Integration tests`](https://github.com/imjohnbo/ok-to-test/blob/master/.github/workflows/integration.yml), and I would need to fill in my tests [here](https://github.com/imjohnbo/ok-to-test/blob/master/.github/workflows/integration.yml#L36).
3. Which workflow(s) do not need [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#about-encrypted-secrets). In this example, it's [`Unit tests`](https://github.com/imjohnbo/ok-to-test/blob/master/.github/workflows/unit.yml). These types of workflows can simply trigger on pull request.

## Usage

As someone with write access, comment `/ok-to-test sha=<head-sha>` on an incoming pull request to set off this [Rube Goldberg machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine) üòÑ. The head `sha` is the first seven characters of the most recent commit of the incoming pull request. [For example](https://github.com/imjohnbo/ok-to-test/pull/5#issuecomment-635368312), `/ok-to-test sha=742c71a`.

## Example

1. A fork pull request is opened.
2. A [unit test workflow](.github/workflows/unit.yml) runs. Secrets are not available to this workflow.
3. Someone with [write access](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/access-permissions-on-github) looks over the pull request code. ‚ö†Ô∏è Before proceeding, they should be sure the code isn't doing anything malicious like secret logging. ‚ö†Ô∏è
4. They comment `/ok-to-test sha=<head-sha>` on the pull request.
5. A `repository_dispatch` API request is sent to this repository. See guidance [below](#Authentication) on how to authenticate.
6. An [integration test workflow](.github/workflows/integration.yml) runs, checking out the merge commit if the head sha hasn't changed since the comment was made. Secrets are available to this workflow! üí´
7. The pull request status check is updated to reflect the success or failure of the integration test workflow.

Note that this sequence also works for branch based pull requests, as you'd expect!

## Authentication

Choose one of these authentication methods for the `repository_dispatch` helper action, `peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch`, in [`ok-to-test.yml`](.github/workflows/ok-to-test.yml):
- [Personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) with `repo` scope
- [OAuth "app" token](https://developer.github.com/v3/#oauth2-token-sent-in-a-header) with `repo` scope
- ‚≠êÔ∏è Preferred: [GitHub App installation access token](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-an-installation) with `contents: write` and `metadata: read` permissions

GitHub Apps have distinct identities on GitHub ‚Äì no seat taken up by a machine account, no potential for leaking your personal credentials, and no rate limit sharing!
